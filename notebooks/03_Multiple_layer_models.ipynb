    "In this notebook we will explore network models with multiple layers of transformations. This will build upon the single-layer affine model we looked at in the previous notebook and use material covered in the [second](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2016/mlp02-sln.pdf) and [third](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2016/mlp03-mlp.pdf) lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use these models for the experiments you will be running in the first coursework so part of the aim of this lab will be to get you familiar with how to construct multiple layer models in our framework and how to train them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when discussing (neural) network models, a network layer is taken to mean an input to output transformation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\vct{y} = \\vct{f}(\\mtx{W} \\vct{x} + \\vct{b})\n",
    "    \\qquad\n",
    "    \\Leftrightarrow\n",
    "    \\qquad\n",
    "    y_k = f\\lpa\\sum_{d=1}^D \\lpa W_{kd} x_d \\rpa + b_k \\rpa\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mtx{W}$ and $\\vct{b}$ parameterise an affine transformation as discussed in the previous notebook, and $f$ is a function applied elementwise to the result of the affine transformation. For example a common choice for $f$ is the logistic sigmoid function \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  f(u) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-u)}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second lecture slides you were shown how to train a model consisting of an affine transformation followed by the elementwise logistic sigmoid using gradient descent. This was referred to as a 'sigmoid single-layer network'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we also referred to single-layer models, where in that case the layer was an affine transformation, with you implementing the various necessary methods for the `AffineLayer` class before using an instance of that class within a `SingleLayerModel` on a regression problem. We could in that case consider the function $f$ to simply be the identity function $f(u) = u$. In the code for the labs we will however use a slightly different convention. Here we will consider the affine transformations and subsequent elementwise function $f$ to each be a separate transformation layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will mean we can combine our already implemented `AffineLayer` class with any non-linear function applied to the outputs just by implementing a layer object for the relevant non-linearity and then stacking the two layers together. An alternative would be to have our new layer objects inherit from `AffineLayer` and then call the relevant parent class methods in the child class however this would mean we need to include a lot of the same boilerplate code in every new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example, in the `mlp.layers` module there is a definition for a `SigmoidLayer` equivalent to the following (documentation strings have been removed here for brevity)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SigmoidLayer(Layer):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fprop(self, inputs):\n",
    "        return 1. / (1. + np.exp(-inputs))\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bprop(self, inputs, outputs, grads_wrt_outputs):\n",
    "        return grads_wrt_outputs * outputs * (1. - outputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see this `SigmoidLayer` class has a very lightweight definition, defining just two key methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `fprop` which takes a batch of activations at the input to the layer and forward propagates them to produce activates at the outputs (directly equivalently to the `fprop` method you implemented for then `AffineLayer` in the previous notebook),\n",
    "  * `brop` which takes a batch of gradients with respect to the outputs of the layer and backward propagates them to calculate gradients with respect to the inputs of the layer (explained in more detail below).\n",
    "  \n",
    "This `SigmoidLayer` class only implements the logistic sigmoid non-linearity transformation and so does not have any parameters. Therefore unlike `AffineLayer` it is derived directly from the base `Layer` class rather than `LayerWithParameters` and does not need to implement `grads_wrt_params` or `params` methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a model consisting of an affine transformation followed by applying an elementwise logistic sigmoid transformation we first create a list of the two layer objects (in the order they are applied from inputs to outputs) and then use this to instantiate a new `MultipleLayerModel` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mlp.layers import AffineLayer, SigmoidLayer\n",
    "from mlp.models import MultipleLayerModel\n",
    "\n",
    "layers = [AffineLayer(input_dim, output_dim), SigmoidLayer()]\n",
    "model = MultipleLayerModel(layers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the modular way in which the layers are defined we can also stack an arbitrarily long sequence of layers together to produce deeper models. For instance the following would define a model consisting of three pairs of affine and logistic sigmoid transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = MultipleLayerModel([\n",

    "## Back-propagation of gradients\n",
    "  \n",
    "To allow training models consisting of a stack of multiple layers, all layers need to implement a `bprop` method in addition to the `fprop` we encountered in the previous week. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `bprop` method takes gradients of an error function with respect to the *outputs* of a layer and uses these gradients to calculate gradients of the error function with respect to the *inputs* of a layer. As the inputs to a non-input layer in a multiple-layer model consist of the outputs of the previous layer, this means we can calculate the gradients of the error function with respect to the outputs of every layer in the model by iteratively propagating the gradients backwards through the layers of the model (i.e. from the last to first layer), hence the term 'back-propagation' or 'bprop' for short. A block diagram illustrating this is shown for a three layer model below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='res/fprop-bprop-block-diagram.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "For a layer with parameters, the gradients with respect to the layer outputs are required to calculate gradients with respect to the layer parameters. Therefore by combining backward propagation of gradients through the model with computing the gradients with respect to parameters in the relevant layers we can calculate gradients of the error function with respect to all of the parameters of a multiple-layer model in a very efficient manner (in fact the computational cost of computing gradients with respect to all of the parameters of the model using this method will only be a constant factor times the cost of calculating the model outputs in the forwards pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "We so far have abstractly talked about calculating gradients with respect to the inputs of a layer using gradients with respect to the layer outputs. More concretely we will be using the chain rule for derivatives to do this, similarly to how we used the chain rule in exercise 4 of the previous notebook to calculate gradients with respect to the parameters of an affine layer given gradients with respect to the outputs of the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular if our layer has a batch of $B$ vector inputs each of dimension $D$, $\\fset{\\vct{x}^{(b)}}_{b=1}^B$, and produces a batch of $B$ vector outputs each of dimension $K$, $\\fset{\\vct{y}^{(b)}}_{b=1}^B$,  then we can calculate the gradient with respect to the $d^\\textrm{th}$ dimension of the $b^{\\textrm{th}}$ input given the gradients with respect to the $b^{\\textrm{th}}$ output using\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically therefore the `bprop` method takes an array of gradients with respect to the outputs $\\pd{\\bar{E}}{y^{(b)}_k}$ and applies a sum-product operation with the partial derivatives of each output with respect to each input $\\pd{y^{(b)}_k}{x^{(b)}_d}$ to produce gradients with respect to the inputs of the layer $\\pd{\\bar{E}}{x^{(b)}_d}$.\n",

This indicates that these models have begun *overfitting* to the training data.

The smaller parameter initialisation scales for the deeper models in particular seem to give poorer initial performance (error curves start from higher values) and for the five affine layer model the smallest parameter initialisation scale run shows a pronounced flatter section at the start of training with around 15 epochs before the error starts significantly decreasing.\n",

    "We might expect the appropriate initialisation scale for a given affine layer to depend on its input and output dimensionalities. Each output is calculated as the weighted sum of all the inputs, and so for a larger number of inputs the typical magnitude of the output activations will become larger as each will be calculate from a sum over more values. Similarly the backpropagated gradient at each input is calculated as a weighted sum over the gradients at each output, and so for a larger number outputs the typical magnitude of backpropagated gradients will become larger.\n",

    "If we wish to keep some measure of the typical magnitude of the activations and backpropagated gradients at a given layer roughly constant through the network then we may therefore wish to set the parameter initialisation in a layer dimensionality dependent way. One heuristic based on trying to achieve a roughly constant variance in activations and backpropagated gradients through the network is to initialise the weights for a layer from a distribution with variance inversely proportional to the sum of the input and output dimensions of the layer. This is sometimes known as the Glorot or Xavier initialisation, after the name of the author of [the paper](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) in which this scheme was proposed. You will use this parameter initialisation scheme in the first coursework.\n",
